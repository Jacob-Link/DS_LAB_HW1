# **HW1 Data Science Lab - Course 094295**

##The required final report should contain:

1. Executive summary

2. Exploratory Data Analysis.
   1. Describing the features that are available in the dataset
   2. Inspecting the features distribution, comparative analysis between features (with plots and 
hypothesis testing)
   3. Handling missing data
3. Feature Engineering
   1. Which feature you will be using (and why)
   2. Features transformations
   3. Data enrichment (if any)
4. Prediction - Use at least 3 different algorithms. For each algorithm report:
   1. The algorithm
   2. Hyperparameter selection, regularization
   3. Training and validation results
   4. Post Analysis (e.g., comparison of model performance on different subgroups), model 
interpretability
5. Summary and Discussion
